         This just a simple snake game demo written in a pure assembler.
                            Rules are very clear:
                  If a snake will touch bordes - game over.
              If a snake will bite it's owne tail - game over.
          The snake must eat some fruits for becoming bigger and faster.
                 By each eaten fruit you will gane some scores.

         Controls:

                 Use the <A>,<D>,<W>,<S> keys for moving a snake.
